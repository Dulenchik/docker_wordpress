# Docker-based Microservice
This is a simple microservice-based application thatâ€™s built of four Docker containers. The application was created as an example for our RubyGarage article.

# Getting Started
Check if Docker is installed on your system. If not, then follow the installation instructions on the Docker website.
Clone the repository and run the following command:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build

Once Docker downloads the images and builds the containers, the app will be running on Docker host on port 80.
